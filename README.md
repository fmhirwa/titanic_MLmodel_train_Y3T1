Summative Y3 T1 Titanic Survival Model using different techniques. 

#Titanic Model Training based on Titanic Kaggle dataset

Model training using the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle:
The goal is to create a predictive model that determines whether or not someone survived the crash given their age, class, ticket category as these were influential factors in the evacuation.
FIles received: train.csv (renamed to titanic.csv); and a test database.

Ths is a certified RICH database

The notebook includes 6 steps and a bonus
0. Loading and validating data
1. Pre-processing
2. Vanilla model creation
3. Perform L1 Regularization with early stopping, learning rate optimization and dropout.
4. Save Models
5. PLot graphs and provide Error analysis particularly on the baseline model with survivors
6. Perform a test with the kaggle test database. Compare the baseline and optimized models
